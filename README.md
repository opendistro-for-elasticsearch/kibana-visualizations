# Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana Visualizations

The Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana Visualizations enables you to use additional types of visualizations inside Kibana Visualize and integrate them in Kibana Dashboard.


## Documentation

Please see our technical [documentation](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/) to learn more about its features.


## Setup

1. Download Elasticsearch for the version that matches the [Kibana version specified in package.json](./package.json#L5).
1. Download the Kibana source code for the [version specified in package.json](./package.json#L5) you want to set up.

   See the [Kibana contributing guide](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-your-development-environment) for more instructions on setting up your development environment.
   
1. Change your node version to the version specified in `.node-version` inside the Kibana root directory.
1. cd into the Kibana source code directory.
1. Check out this package from version control into the `plugins` directory.
```
rm plugins -r
git clone git@github.com:opendistro-for-elasticsearch/kibana-visualizations.git plugins --no-checkout
cd plugins
echo 'gantt-chart/*' >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git config core.sparseCheckout true
git checkout main
```
6. Run `yarn kbn bootstrap` inside `kibana` directory.

Ultimately, your directory structure should look like this:

```md
.
├── kibana
│   └── plugins
│       └── gantt-chart
```
